## 🧠 Curiosity & Research ## 🧠 

I’m someone who loves to ask *“Why?”* and *“How?”* — especially when it comes to:
- 🌌 Astronomy & Cosmic Mysteries (Origin of the universe, black holes, time, etc.)
- 🔭 Have a great interest to do research in astronomy
- 💻 Deeply fascinated by **how computers truly work** — from electricity to binary to logic gates
- 📱Exploring the inner mechanisms of interpreters, data structures, and AI
-🌟 Dreaming of contributing to AI tools that shape the future

This curiosity drives the way I code, learn, and solve problems. For me, programming isn’t just about syntax — it’s about **dissecting how systems work and imagining what's next**.
